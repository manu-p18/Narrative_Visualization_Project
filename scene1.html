        <p>On the left is a chart of the frequency of UFO sightings by country. The data
            spans from 1906 to 2014. 
        </p>
        <p> A singular bar immediately stands out. The frequency
            of sightings in the US is many times greater than the number of sightings of all other 
            countries in the dataset. <b>(Hovering over each bar shows exactly how many such sightings there has been)</b> </p>
        <p> What could be the reason for this? Perhaps the biggest influencer is <b>culture</b>. 
            Movies, TV shows, books, and other media have been portraying aliens since the early 20th century. Especially
            the 1953 film 'The War of the Worlds', as well as the 1898 novel that it was inspired by, contributed greatly
            to beginnning American's fascination with UFOs and extraterrestrials.
        </p>
        <p> When such a history exists with this unique interest in UFOs, it becomes easier to attribute unknown phenomena to 
            UFO sightings. In other countries where the connection with UFOs is not as deep, it may  be that the people of that
            country attribute unknown phenomena with things other than UFOs. In the next scene, we will explore another way this
            groupthink may be affecting people's perceptions of UFOs.
