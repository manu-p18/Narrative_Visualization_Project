        <p> In the dataset for the sightings of UFOs in the past century, an interesting column we have is shape. It
            is the general description of the shape of the craft as was reported. <b>Scrolling over the wedges will give an exact
                number of shape reported.</b>
        </p>
        <p> The prevalence of similar UFO sightings reporting the same shape can be attributed to the concept of <b>collective perception</b>. 
            Human beings are naturally influenced by shared beliefs and experiences, and this can be seen in the chart. Once a specific shape, 
            such as a classic saucer or a triangular craft, gains popularity in UFO lore through past reports or media depictions, it becomes 
            ingrained in the public consciousness. </p>
        <p> Consequently, when individuals witness mysterious aerial phenomena, they may be predisposed 
            to describe what they saw in alignment with the established descriptions. This desire to conform to prevailing narratives could be 
            contributing to a significant 
            number of UFO sightings seemingly featuring the same shape, even if the reality of these phenomena remains open to interpretation.
